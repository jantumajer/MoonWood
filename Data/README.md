# Dendrometer and climatic data

Each file contains mean dendrometric series (GRO = growth rate, TWD = tree water deficit) and mean climatic variables (air temperature, VPD = vapour pressure deficit) averaged at species level in hourly resolution between January 2015 and December 2020.

**NOTE: Although nonzero values of GRO and TWD cannot occurr at the same timestep at the level of individual trees [(Zweifel et al. 2016)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.13995), the data presented here are averaged at species level. Therefore, both variables often have nonzero values at the same time. This is due to individual trees experiencing GRO events while the others shrinking and nonzero TWD at the same moment.**
